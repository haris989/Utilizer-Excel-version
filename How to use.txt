Utilizer is a software that works based on a greedy algorithm which finds the orientation 
of the boxes to be kept inside Truck/Roll cages for optimal packing.
Utilizer takes care of the constraints like not rotating Length-by-height/Breadth-by-height, stacking norms etc.

EXCEL VERSION OF THE UTILIZER IS THE EASIEST TO USE VERSION!
Copy the contents of the CD/Github repo somewhere in your C drive. 
It is not possible to run Utilizer directly from the CD since windows does not allow writing to non rewritable CDs.
Open the Excel file and input the data in the columns.
Click pack CFCs.
Go to sheet 2 and visualize the results.
Although the results shall display without clicking the two buttons, it is recommended to click Refresh Data and Refresh Brands buttons.
Please don't click Refresh brands before Refresh data
