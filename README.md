Optimal packing is an important need of most of the organizations who need to pack cuboid items for transporting goods from one place to the other. Utilizer is a software which suggests the orientation of the cartons inside a container so as to pack them for optimal packing. Since most of the companies have stacking norms for their products, Utilizer does not rotate the cartons in height.
Since most of the companies use their data in Ms-Excel like spreadsheets.
